# ToDo and Other Information

##ToDo
* Everything
* Intermediary class between the sql database and interface needs to be constructed.

## Notes
* For the SQL datatypes, all simple types are safe (ints, chars, floats, etc.).
* For strings (in the database), do not use the text data type. Just use varchar(255).
* The SelectAll() function works and is formatted.
