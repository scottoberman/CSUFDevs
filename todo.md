# ToDo and Other Information

##ToDo
* More distinct functions instead of generics (As far as SQL functions are concerned).
* Better formatting on select related functions (related to above bullet).
* More error checking between sql and map functions.

## Notes
* For the SQL datatypes, all simple types are safe (ints, chars, floats, etc.).
* For strings (in the database), do not use the text data type. Just use varchar(255).
