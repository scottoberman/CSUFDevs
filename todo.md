# ToDo and Other Information

##ToDo
* Everything

## Notes
* For the SQL datatypes, all simple types are safe (ints, chars, floats, etc.).\n
* For strings, only use the text datatype. Do not use varchar in the current state of things.
* The SelectAll() function is functional but useful for really only debugging at the moment.
