# ToDo and Other Information

##ToDo
* Get the BST/Map system implemented.
* More distinct functions instead of generics.
* Better formatting on select related functions (related to above bullet).
* Exception handlers for invalid data type on std::cin statements.

## Notes
* Functional with exception of the BST/Map system.
 * Should be presentable for iteration one in this state if the BST/Map system is not implemented.
* For the SQL datatypes, all simple types are safe (ints, chars, floats, etc.).
* For strings (in the database), do not use the text data type. Just use varchar(255).
* The SelectAll() function works and is formatted.
